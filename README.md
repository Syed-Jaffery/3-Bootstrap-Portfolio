## Description

A portfolio site is essential to showcase a collection of past projects when applying for a job or seeking freelance work. 

The types of projects in the portfolio should demonstrate different aspects of web development with the use of specific frameworks and technologies.


###  Oveview

This portfolio website specifically requires the use of the Bootstrap framework in order to demonstrate competence in its use.

The website is effectively a template that can be added to as new projects are completed. 

The first project - Health Check is a real project and the 'Visit Website' button links to the site.

The other projects listed are just 'dummy' projects shown only to enhance the page layout.
